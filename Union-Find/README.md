## Brief

**Union:** connecting two objects.
**Find:** Is there a path connecting 2 objects?

```cpp
template <typename T>
void union(T a, T b) {
    // Connect a and b
}

template <typename T>
bool find(T a, T b) {
    // are a and b connected?
}
```

Question that we are trying to answer: Is there a path connecting point p and q?
